GitHub Copilot was useful in figuring out my Heroku deployment issues. Heroku is always tricky but I'm starting to get the hang of it :)

I used [Material Ui](https://mui.com/) for my CSS. The [documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) was very useful for learning everything from simple component structure to creating my own theme.

I used [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMq2riFCF90) to make my contact form functional.

For my resume page, [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42042901/setting-iframe-height-to-scrollheight-in-reactjs) Stack Overflow page led me to [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iframe-resizer-react) NPM package documentation.
